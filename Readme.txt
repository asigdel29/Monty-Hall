This function creates a list of three doors, with one door containing a car and the other two containing goats. It then randomly selects a winning door and a chosen door. If the chosen door is not the winning door, the function simulates the host opening one of the remaining doors that does not contain the car. Finally, it prints out the winning door, the chosen door, the opened door, and the result of switching to the remaining unopened door.
